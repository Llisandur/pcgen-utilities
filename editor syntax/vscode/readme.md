Copy the entire "pcgen" folder to your VSCode extensions folder.

Extensions are installed in a per user extensions folder. Depending on your platform, the location is in the following folder:
Windows %USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions
macOS ~/.vscode/extensions
Linux ~/.vscode/extensions

Files with the .lst and .pcc file extensions should automatically be detected. To select the file type manually in an opened file, select the option in the lower-right corner of the window and type or select "PCGen" in the command palette. Alternately, the keyboard shortkut is "ctrl+k" then "m", then types or select "PCGen" as before.
